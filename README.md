# SwitchDualShockAdapter

A work-in-progress Dual Shock to Switch controller adapter using an ATMega8A and V-USB.

**So far, all this does is create a fake controller that alternately presses left and right on the dpad every second.**

I'm documenting the project on my blog, https://www.blog.montgomerie.net/tags/switch-dual-shock-adapter-series/.
