# SwitchDualShockAdapter

A work-in-progress Dual Shock to Switch controller adapter using an ATMega8A and V-USB.

**So far, all this is is a PlatformIO project that can cause an ATMega8 to blink an LED attached to pin 19.**

I'm documenting the project on my blog, https://www.blog.montgomerie.net/.
