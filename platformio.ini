;    -DDEBUG_LEVEL=2

; Chip configuration:
; This configures the _software_ to assume a 12.8 MHz clock - it does not affect
; the chip itself (the fuses defined in the bootloader environment, below set up
; the internal oscilator at 8MHz). We tune it at runtime, in software, to run
; at 12.8MHz.

; PlatformIO serial monitor settings, for serial debugging:
; A reliable speed for 12.8MHz and 16MHz.

; Program upload settings:
; Use the bootloader that the 'ATmega8Bootloader' environment below sets up.
; On Windows, `upload_port` might be e.g. 'COM1' rather than a path.
; On Mac and Linux, the path might differ depending on the Arduino and/or
; serial connection.

; Sadly-needed workarounds:
; -e:
;   From the 'avrdude' docs: "Causes a chip erase to be executed. This will
;   reset the contents of the flash ROM and EEPROM to the value ‘0xff’, and
;   clear all lock bits. Except for ATxmega devices which can use page erase, it
;   is basically a prerequisite command before the flash ROM can be reprogrammed
;   again. The only exception would be if the new contents would exclusively
;   cause bits to be programmed from the value ‘1’ to ‘0’."
; -P and -b:
;   PlatfomIO's '--target bootloader' doesn't work without it - the 'upload_XXX'
;   settings are not used even though they need to be.
; -u:
;   Work around the same issue relating to a  "fake" efuse described as
;   affecting the Windows Arduino IDE here:
;   https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/issues/844
